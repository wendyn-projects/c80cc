 - Single layer PCB

## Story behing this Project
I am waiting for [Triple Jump](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/morphcat-games/triple-jump-a-platformer-multi-cartridge-for-the-nes) cartridge, which has a game for **4** players. So I ordered [Four Score](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NES_Four_Score) but I have only 2 controllers and I didn't want to pay that much money for something that shouldn't cost that much.

So I tried to find a board that I could print myself but I couldn't find one that didn't suck.
I ended up finding a project that claimed "it exists for anyone to modify to create your own controller" _or something like that_ and it was made in paid software üôÑ.
So I thought I could at least take dimensions from it using some free online viewer but I found out they used imperial units with something that was clearly made with metric system ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è.
I ended up just taking a controller apart and overlaying it on my screen to place the holes in what I hope are correct locations.
_I was using a caliper at first but it was quite tedious and the error was actually pretty high with the holes. ~~skill issue~~_

This is actually my first PCB so I actually don't know any good practices.
I hope I did pretty well.

# TODOs:
- [ ] Round the sharp cuts.
- [ ] Fix warnings about the membrane button pads colliding with the microswitch pads _(they are connected on purpose)_.
